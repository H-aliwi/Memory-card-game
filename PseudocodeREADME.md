### ***Pseudocode***
#### - When I click on a cell, its hidden image must be showing, and if I click again on a different cell, it does the same, and then I will see if both images are the same.

#### - If the two images are the same, then increment the counter found and make them both visibl else return both images to be hidden again.

#### - When counter reaches 8, then the player wins the game.

#### - If a button resegame clicks, then return all cell's images to be hidden and return the counter to 0.

#### - A cell that's image is visible, then it cannot be clicked again to look for similar cell images.
