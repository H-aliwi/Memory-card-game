### ***Pseudocode***
#### - The cells must be filled with images/colors randomly.

#### - When I click on a cell, its hidden image must be showing, and if I click again on a different cell, it does the same, and then I will see if both images are the same.

#### - If the two images are the same, then increment the counter found and make them both visible else return both images to be hidden again.

#### - When counter reaches 8, then the player wins the game in CASE of 4*4 grid.

#### - If a button resegame clicks, then return all cell's images to be hidden and return the counter to 0 andl also the time.

#### - The cells that there images is visible(Matched found), then it cannot be clicked again to look for similar cell images.

#### - When Matched happen for cells then play a sound effect for it, also for matched failed and in CASE win happen.

#### - When Matched failed happen then both cells Matched must be visible for few seconds for the player and then hidden them again.

#### - When win happen, the cells cannot be clicked.
